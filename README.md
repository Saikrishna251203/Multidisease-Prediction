# Multi-Disease Prediction

## Overview

The Multi-Disease Prediction project is a machine learning application designed to predict the likelihood of multiple diseases based on patient data. This project aims to aid healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases with improved accuracy and efficiency.

## Features

- Predicts multiple diseases based on patient input
- Implements various machine learning models for prediction
- Provides a command-line interface for user input
- Outputs prediction results for different diseases

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation and development)
